**TFIP Software Engineering trainee, [DBS Bank](https://sg.linkedin.com/company/dbs-bank)**

**GitHub <github.com/Boxyboxy>** - Optional

**LinkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugenengboxiang/>**

I am a Mechanical Engineering Graduate and started my Software Engineering career in late 2021 via the Technology in Finance Immersion programme. The programme includes a bootcamp (Angular, JavaSpring and basic SQL) and an attachment with a Financial Institute for a period of 12 months.

Currently, I am attached to DBS - Middle Office Technology and we support the re-platforming of internal applications. My exposure in DBS includes SQL, Shell Scripting, Scala and Apache Spark. My present responsibilities involve data engineering work and I am supporting the development for a data pipeline between an upstream of mainframe systems and a downstream system that serves to presenting data in a UI and generating reports for users.

Outside of work, I am attending a part time bootcamp by Rocket Academy. The curriculum includes the MERN stack and basic Data Structures and Algorithms.

I love nature and anything movement-related! On my free time, I like to read, run, yoga and climb.
